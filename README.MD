# Simple CRUD REST API for blog posts

This repository contains a very simple [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) REST API created using [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/).

It is partly based on [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/create-rest-api-fastify/) but updated to use ESM imports instead of CommonJS.
